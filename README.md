# NetworkMonitor
Once opened, this small utility program displays the current upload and download speeds, as well the total uploaded and downloaded data since booting up.


## History
Whenever I had connectivity issues in an online game or in video chat, I just wanted to know if it was a server side problem, or my computer is transferring too much data on the internet.
Meaning if I can measure too much download/ upload speeds, I can shut down some network related process on my pc.
